# 30-frontend-projects-challenge
This challenge contains 30 frontend projects built with vanilla HTML,CSS and Javascript.

I took up this challenge to develop 30 frontend projects based on vanilla HTML5, css and
javascript to level up my skills in frontend web development. I take a PSD design and the convert it into a functional website using modern css tools like Flexbox and grid-system.

This projects are fully responsive and are supported on various browsers like chrome and firefox.

I attribute credit to [Michael Reimer](www.bestpsdfreebies.com) from bestpsdfreebies.com for the psd designs
